'''
I am trying to filter out empty arrays from an array.
In other words,
I want to transform something that looks like this: ["a", "b", [], [], [1, 2, 3]]
to look like ["a", "b", [1, 2, 3]]. My code looks like this:
'''


def remove_empty_arrays(arr):
    return [x for x in arr if x]


print(remove_empty_arrays([1, 2, [], 4]))

'''
However, it seems that I've run into a problem, with an error message of object
of type 'int' has no len(). Fix my code so that all tests pass.

# ERROR: Traceback:
